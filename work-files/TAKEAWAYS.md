Of course, the devil is in the details--and there are plenty that I don't go into here. My English professor in college would say, "You could drive a freight train through the ignorance of any one of us, and it would never be seen again." For some things, it's due to negligence or forgetfulness, but mostly it's because I genuinely believe that you shouldn't listen to me talk about themâ€”you should just try them yourself! Do whatever works for you; that should be a takeaway here too.
